[-] Proper history movement with arrow
[-] Remove scroll bars in history
[-] Add "stick to bottom" for history
[-] Add hide and show command in default commands
[-] Add support for multiline console definition of tables
[-] Add script search path
-? Add support for tab in editor (it's actually quite convenient to be able to change gui element with a tab..)

Polishing Graphics:
===================
> The console now uses Imgui, it is therefore hard to polish. These improvement would add graphical elements and make it easier to create
> other graphical implementation of the console

- Move to a cleaner MVC model
- Add colour to log

Polishing Code: 
===============
> The point of these is to increase the quantity of coding functunality the console offers, this would be done by
> a parser which would (1) : test certain element of correction (2) : interpretet certain extra element into lua code before it
> is executed

- Add dialect element :
	- command structure
	- easy access to gameobjects
	- easy access to components of object (not have to use getComponent)
- Add correction for partial command line
